### Opting-Out Of Use Of Certain Information Collected By Tracking Technologies

Tracking Technologies Set by Third Party Advertising Service Providers and Similar Third Parties – For more information about Third Party Advertising Service Providers and similar entities that use tracking technologies, see www.aboutads.info/consumers, and to opt-out of such Third Party Advertising Service Providers advertising practices, go to www.aboutads.info/choices.

Tracking Technologies That We Use and Set on the Services – Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies (other than Flash cookies), but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information. Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe’s website, see [http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html]().

Certain browsers transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites in which such browsers communicate with; however, this feature, and how it is used and activated, varies from browser to browser. It is not clear whether the signals are intentionally transmitted by a User, or whether a User is even aware of this. Despite current efforts, there is still disagreement amongst leading Internet standards organizations, industry groups, technology companies and regulators, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals and no standard has been adopted to date. With respect to “do not track signals”, we currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if a standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.

Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, Content and/or other personalization available through the Services.
